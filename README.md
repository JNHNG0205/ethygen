**Main Components**

| Component                                     | Role                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**                                      | Interacts through Privy smart wallet (gasless & signatureless UX) |
| **Frontend (UI + Explorer)**                  | Displays unified balance, staking yield, and trading interface    |
| **Avail Nexus**                               | Aggregates multi-chain assets and unifies balances as USDC        |
| **Vault Contract (USDe)**                     | Holds USDe and manages staking/unstaking                          |
| **Yield Engine**                              | Stakes USDe to earn yield and mints sUSDe                         |
| **yUSDe Minting Module**                      | Issues yUSDe margin tokens at 0.8:1 ratio for trading             |
| **Perp DEX Smart Contract (on Ethereum Sepolia)** | Executes perpetual trades using yUSDe                             |
| **Pyth Oracle**                               | Provides real-time asset prices for accurate trading data         |
| **Envio**                                     | Indexes on-chain events and provides analytics data for frontend  |

## ðŸ”„ User Flow

### **Deposit Flow**

1. **User deposits assets** (ETH, USDC, etc.) into their **Privy Smart Wallet**.
2. **Avail Nexus** aggregates all balances from multiple EVM chains and displays them as a **unified USDC balance**.
3. The user **bridges USDC â†’ Base chain** and swaps USDC â†’ **USDe**, stored inside the **Vault Contract**.
4. The **Vault** stakes USDe through the **Yield Engine**, minting **sUSDe** to represent staked positions.
5. The user can then **swap sUSDe â†’ yUSDe** (margin token) at a **0.8:1 ratio**, which is used for **perpetual trading**.

---

### **Withdraw Flow**

1. When the **user closes a trade**, they receive **yUSDe** (with profits or losses reflected in its value).
2. The user can **redeem yUSDe â†’ sUSDe** through the vault.
3. The vault **unstakes sUSDe â†’ USDe**, returning the userâ€™s yield-adjusted balance.
4. The user **swaps USDe â†’ Base USDC**, completing the withdrawal process.

---

## ðŸ§  Example Scenarios

### **Winning Trade**

* User opens a long position with 80 yUSDe margin.
* The market moves favorably â†’ profit added to vaultâ€™s balance.
* User closes trade and receives more yUSDe (reflecting gains).
* They redeem yUSDe â†’ sUSDe â†’ USDe â†’ Base USDC.

### **Losing Trade**

* Userâ€™s position moves against them â†’ margin loss occurs.
* The corresponding portion of **sUSDe** in the vault is burned to cover the loss.
* User receives reduced yUSDe upon trade closure â†’ redeems to smaller USDe amount.

---

## ðŸ”§ How Itâ€™s Made

Ethygen is built using:

* **Avail Nexus** â†’ For unified cross-chain collateral aggregation.
* **Pyth** â†’ For real-time, decentralized price feeds in perpetual trading.
* **Envio** â†’ For indexing and querying trading data efficiently.

Smart contracts are deployed on **Ethereum Sepolia** testnet, and mock tokens are used for **USDe**, **sUSDe**, and **yUSDe** for simulation.
