## ðŸ§© System Architecture



**Main Components**

| Component                                     | Role                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**                                      | Interacts through Privy smart wallet (gasless & signatureless UX) |
| **Frontend (UI + Explorer)**                  | Displays unified balance, staking yield, and trading interface    |
| **Avail Nexus**                               | Aggregates multi-chain assets and unifies balances as USDC        |
| **Vault Contract (USDe)**                     | Holds USDe and manages staking/unstaking                          |
| **Yield Engine**                              | Stakes USDe to earn yield and mints sUSDe                         |
| **yUSDe Minting Module**                      | Issues yUSDe margin tokens at 0.8:1 ratio for trading             |
| **Perp DEX Smart Contract                     | Executes perpetual trades using yUSDe                             |
| **Pyth Oracle**                               | Provides real-time asset prices for accurate trading data         |

## ðŸ”„ User Flow

### **Deposit Flow**

1. **User deposits assets** (ETH, USDC, etc.) into their **Privy Smart Wallet**.  
2. **Avail Nexus** aggregates balances across EVM chains and displays them as a **unified USDC balance**.  
3. The user **bridges USDC â†’ Base** and swaps to **USDe**, stored in the **Vault Contract**.  
4. The **Vault** stakes the USDe in the **Yield Engine**, receiving **sUSDe**.  
5. The user can then **mint yUSDe (margin token)** at a **0.8:1 ratio**, which is **backed by sUSDe**.  
6. **Even if unused in trading**, yUSDe continues to **earn yield** because its underlying sUSDe remains staked in the vault.  

---

### **Trading Flow**

1. The **Perp DEX** uses **yUSDe** as collateral for margin trading.  
2. Trades are executed on **Base Sepolia**, powered by **Pyth price feeds**.  
3. Gains or losses are reflected in the **yUSDe balance**, not affecting the underlying yield stream of untraded funds.

---

### **Withdraw Flow**

1. When users close trades, their **yUSDe balance (profit/loss adjusted)** is updated.  
2. They can **redeem yUSDe â†’ sUSDe** through the vault.  
3. The vault **unstakes sUSDe â†’ USDe**, returning yield-adjusted value.  
4. Finally, the user **swaps USDe â†’ Base USDC** for withdrawal.

---

## ðŸ§  Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Idle Funds (No Trading)**

* User mints **100 yUSDe** but does not open any trades.  
* yUSDe remains backed by 125 sUSDe (at 0.8:1 mint ratio).  
* Yield continues accruing via the **sUSDe staking position**.  
* Over time, userâ€™s vault balance increases without any active trading.

---

### **Scenario 2: Winning Trade**

* User opens a 10x long position using 80 yUSDe.  
* Market moves favorably â†’ profit reflected in userâ€™s yUSDe balance.  
* Upon closing the trade, user redeems yUSDe â†’ sUSDe â†’ USDe, receiving both profit + accrued yield.

---

### **Scenario 3: Losing Trade**

* Userâ€™s trade moves against them â†’ margin loss occurs.  
* The corresponding amount of sUSDe is **burned** to cover losses.  
* Remaining sUSDe continues to earn yield for the user.  

---

## ðŸ”§ How Itâ€™s Made

Ethygen is built using:

* **Avail Nexus** â†’ For unified cross-chain collateral aggregation.
* **Pyth** â†’ For real-time, decentralized price feeds in perpetual trading.

Smart contracts are deployed on **Ethereum Sepolia** testnet, and mock tokens are used for **USDe**, **sUSDe**, and **yUSDe** for simulation.
