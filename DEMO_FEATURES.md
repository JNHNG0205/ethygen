# Demo Features - Hardcoded Frontend

This document describes the interactive demo pages with hardcoded data that showcase the complete user flows.

## Overview

The demo is accessible at `/demo` and includes three fully functional flows with simulated data and animations:

1. **Deposit Flow** - Multi-chain aggregation â†’ USDe conversion â†’ yUSDe minting
2. **Trading Flow** - Position management with yUSDe collateral
3. **Withdraw Flow** - yUSDe redemption â†’ sUSDe unstaking â†’ withdrawal

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Highlights

- **Zero Integration Required** - All data is hardcoded, no contract calls needed
- **Full Animations** - Step-by-step progress indicators with loading states
- **Interactive UI** - Adjustable inputs with real-time calculations
- **Educational** - Each step clearly explains what's happening
- **Mobile Responsive** - Works on all screen sizes

### 4. `DemoPage` (`app/demo/page.tsx`)

**Layout:**
- Tabbed interface for easy navigation between flows
- Feature highlights section at the bottom
- Consistent design with main app

## Design Principles

1. **Visual Clarity** - Each step clearly labeled with visual indicators
2. **Progress Feedback** - Loading states and completion checkmarks
3. **Educational** - Explanations for each conversion step
4. **Color Coding** - 
   - Cyan: USDe/yUSDe operations
   - Purple: Yield/APY indicators
   - Green: Profits/receipts
   - Red: Losses/warnings

## Technical Notes

- All calculations are done client-side with hardcoded values
- No external API calls or contract interactions
- Uses existing UI components from `@/components/ui`
- Fully responsive with Tailwind CSS
- Uses Framer Motion for animations (imported where needed)

## Future Enhancements

When ready to integrate real data:
1. Replace hardcoded values with hooks from `@/hooks`
2. Add real-time balance fetching
3. Implement actual contract interactions
4. Add error handling for failed transactions
5. Connect to live price feeds

## Running the Demo

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/demo`
3. Click through each tab to explore the flows
4. Interact with inputs and buttons to see the animations
